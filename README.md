# Studying the Growth Factor
Author: João Rebouças, April 2025

This is a simple study of the matter perturbation equations in the Newtonian gauge. The plan is to make a video evolving some matter structure across redshift. We simulate an initial matter field, solve the matter perturbation equations (making a lot of assumptions), rescale the initial power spectrum using the transfer functions, and then plotting the resulting matter field for some redshift values.
